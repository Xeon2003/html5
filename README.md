DESCRIPTION
===========

**html5** is a HTML5-DOM library that has been written in Python.

The library has been used as a replacement for the Python library shipped with
the PyJS development framework enabling HTML5-client application development
in Python.

This library serves as a toolkit used for various PyJS-based apps having their
origin at Mausbrand. The most prominent software using this library is the
**vi**, the visual administration interface for ViUR-based applications.

More about the vi reference implementation can be obtained from the official
Bitbucket repository at https://bitbucket.org/viur/vi.
